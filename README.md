# Strive Robotics, AREN

## Overview
Introducing AREN, a bipedal robot for use in STEAM education around the world. Aimed at youths with no background in programming, this comprehensive kit and course will bring you through everything that you need to know to start off in the world of robotics.

The files found inside this repository can be categorised into the following:
- The individual Arduino sketches/programs
- The libraries required to run the sketches
- Github related files (README.md, .gitignore)

## Uploading the Code
In order to run and upload the individual Arduino sketches/programs, there are a few things you need to do first.

### Windows
If you are on Windows, move the contents of the "libraries" folder into your local Arduino library folder typically found in C:\Documents\Arduino\libraries\

Once you're done, you can launch the .ino files and upload them to your Arduino successfully.

### MacOS
If you are on MacOS, move the contents of the "libraries" folder into your local Arduino library folder typically found in ~/Users/(NAME)/Documents/Arduino/libraries

Once you're done, you can launch the .ino files and upload them to your Arduino successfully.

### Alternative Method
*This applies to both Windows & MacOS*
First move the downloaded repository to your location of choice. Next, change the "Sketchbook Location" from the Arduino "Preferences" to where you saved the downloaded repository.

Now, you should be able to launch the .ino files and upload them successfully.
